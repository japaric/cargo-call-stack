**HEADS UP**: This tool relies on an experimental feature (`-Z stack-sizes`)
and implementation details of `rustc` (like symbol mangling) and could stop
working with a nightly toolchain at any time. You have been warned!

## Features

- The tool produces the full call graph of a program as a [dot file].

[dot file]: https://www.graphviz.org/doc/info/lang.html

- A [start point](#start-point) can be specified to analyze only the call graph
  that begins at that function.

- Each node (function) in the call graph includes the local stack usage of the
  function, *if* available (see [`-Z emit-stack-sizes`]).

[`-Z emit-stack-sizes`]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/unstable-book/compiler-flags/emit-stack-sizes.html

- The *maximum stack usage* of each function is also computed, or at least a
  lower bound is provided. Maximum stack usage of a function here refers to the
  stack usage that includes the stack used by functions that the function may
  invoke.

- The tool has *imperfect* support for calls through function pointers (`fn()`)
  and dynamic dispatch (`dyn Trait`). You *will* get a call graph from programs
  that do indirect calls but it will likely be missing edges or contain
  incorrect edges. It's best to use this tool on programs that only do direct
  function calls.

## Installation

``` console
$ # NOTE always use the latest stable release
$ cargo +stable install cargo-call-stack
```

## Example usage

The tool builds your program in release mode with LTO enabled, analyses it and
then prints a dot file to stdout. See `cargo call-stack -h` for a list of build
options (e.g. `--features`).

[`cortex-m-rt`]: https://crates.io/crates/cortex-m-rt

``` console
$ cargo +nightly call-stack --example app 2> cg.dot
warning: assuming that asm!("") does *not* use the stack
warning: assuming that asm!("") does *not* use the stack
```

Graphviz's `dot` can then be used to generate an image from this dot file.

``` console
$ dot -Tsvg cg.dot > cg.svg
```

[![Call graph with direct function calls](assets/direct.png)](https://japaric.github.io/cargo-call-stack/direct.svg)

Each node in this graph represents a function, which could be a free function,
an inherent method or a trait method. Each directed edge indicates a "calls"
relationship. For example, in the above graph `Reset` calls both `main` and
`DefaultPreInit`.

Each node also contains its `local` stack usage in bytes and its `max`-imum
stack usage, also in bytes. The maximum stack usage includes the stack usage of
all the other functions that the function could invoke.

This is the `no_std` program used to generate the call graph shown above.

``` rust
#![feature(asm)]
#![no_main]
#![no_std]

extern crate panic_halt;

use core::ptr;

use cortex_m_rt::{entry, exception};

#[entry]
fn main() -> ! {
    foo();

    bar();

    loop {}
}

#[inline(never)]
fn foo() {
    // spill variables onto the stack
    unsafe { asm!("" : : "r"(0) "r"(1) "r"(2) "r"(3) "r"(4) "r"(5)) }
}

#[inline(never)]
fn bar() {
    unsafe { asm!("" : : "r"(0) "r"(1) "r"(2) "r"(3) "r"(4) "r"(5) "r"(6) "r"(7)) }
}

#[exception]
fn SysTick() {
    bar();
}

#[inline(never)]
fn baz() {
    let x = 0;
    unsafe {
        // force `x` to be on the stack
        ptr::read_volatile(&&x);
    }

}
```

> In the previous example the call graph contained disconnected subgraphs. The
> reason for that is *exceptions* (also known as interrupts). `SysTick`, for
> example, is an exception handler that can preempt any function called from
> `Reset`. This exception handler is never called from software but can be

## Start point

In some cases you may be interested in the maximum stack usage of a particular
function. The tool lets you specify a *start point* which will be used to filter
the call graph to only include nodes reachable from that function.

If we invoke the tool on the previous program but select `main` as the start
point we get this call graph:

``` console
$ cargo +nightly call-stack --example app main > cg.dot
warning: assuming that asm!("") does *not* use the stack
warning: assuming that asm!("") does *not* use the stack
```

<p align="center">
  <a href="https://japaric.github.io/cargo-call-stack/filtered.svg">
    <img alt="Filtered call graph" src="assets/filtered.png">
  </a>
</p>

Notice that `SysTick` and `baz` don't appear in this call graph since they are
not reachable from `main`.

## Cycles

The tool can, in some cases, compute the maximum stack usage of programs that
involve recursion. Recursion appears as cycles in the call graph. Consider the
following example:

``` rust
#![feature(asm)]
#![no_main]
#![no_std]

extern crate panic_halt;

use core::sync::atomic::{AtomicBool, Ordering};

use cortex_m_rt::{entry, exception};

static X: AtomicBool = AtomicBool::new(true);

#[inline(never)]
#[entry]
fn main() -> ! {
    foo();

    quux();

    loop {}
}

// these three functions form a cycle that breaks when `SysTick` runs
#[inline(never)]
fn foo() {
    if X.load(Ordering::Relaxed) {
        bar()
    }
}

#[inline(never)]
fn bar() {
    if X.load(Ordering::Relaxed) {
        baz()
    }
}

#[inline(never)]
fn baz() {
    if X.load(Ordering::Relaxed) {
        foo()
    }
}

#[inline(never)]
fn quux() {
    // spill variables onto the stack
    unsafe { asm!("" : : "r"(0) "r"(1) "r"(2) "r"(3) "r"(4) "r"(5)) }
}

#[exception]
fn SysTick() {
    X.store(false, Ordering::Relaxed);
}
```

It produces the following call graph:

<p align="center">
  <a href="https://japaric.github.io/cargo-call-stack/cycle.svg">
    <img alt="Call graph with a cycle" src="assets/cycle.png">
  </a>
</p>

The functions `foo`, `bar` and `baz` use zero stack space thus the cycle formed
by them also uses zero stack space. In this particular case the maximum stack
usage of `main` can be computed.

For the curious this is the disassembly of the "cyclic" program:

And yes, the estimated maximum stack usage is correct as shown in this debug

```

## Trait object dispatch

In *some* cases the tool can produce correct call graphs for programs that use
trait objects -- more details about where and how it fails in the ["Known
limitations"](#known-limitations) section. Here's an example:

``` rust
#![feature(asm)]
#![no_main]
#![no_std]

extern crate panic_halt;

use cortex_m_rt::{entry, exception};
use spin::Mutex; // spin = "0.5.0"

static TO: Mutex<&'static (dyn Foo + Sync)> = Mutex::new(&Bar);

#[entry]
#[inline(never)]
fn main() -> ! {
    // trait object dispatch
    (*TO.lock()).foo();

    Quux.foo();

    loop {}
}

trait Foo {
    // default implementation of this method
    fn foo(&self) -> bool {
        // spill variables onto the stack
        unsafe { asm!("" : : "r"(0) "r"(1) "r"(2) "r"(3) "r"(4) "r"(5)) }

        false
    }
}

struct Bar;

// uses the default method implementation
impl Foo for Bar {}

struct Baz;

impl Foo for Baz {
    // overrides the default method
    fn foo(&self) -> bool {
        unsafe { asm!("" : : "r"(0) "r"(1) "r"(2) "r"(3) "r"(4) "r"(5) "r"(6) "r"(7)) }

        true
    }
}

struct Quux;

impl Quux {
    // not a trait method!
    #[inline(never)]
    fn foo(&self) -> bool {
        // NOTE(asm!) side effect to preserve function calls to this method
        unsafe { asm!("NOP" : : : : "volatile") }

        false
    }
}

// this handler can change the trait object at any time
#[exception]
fn SysTick() {
    *TO.lock() = &Baz;
}
```

The tool produces the following call graph:

<p align="center">
  <a href="https://japaric.github.io/cargo-call-stack/to.svg">
    <img alt="Dynamic dispatch" src="assets/to.png">
  </a>
</p>

Here `i1 ({}*)` denotes dynamic dispatch of a method with (Rust) signature
`fn(&[mut] self) -> bool`. The dynamic dispatch can invoke either `Bar.foo`,
which boils down to the default method implementation (`app::Foo::foo` in the
graph), or `Baz.foo` (`<app::Baz as app::Foo>::foo` in the graph). In this case
the tool does *not* a draw an edge between `i1 ({}*)` and `Quux::foo`, whose
signature is also `fn(&self) -> bool`, so the call graph is accurate.

If you are wondering why we use LLVM notation for the function signature of the
trait method: that's because the tool operates on LLVM-IR where there's no
`bool` primitive and most of Rust's type information has been erased.

## Function pointers

In *some* cases the tool can produce correct call graphs for programs that
invoke functions via pointers (e.g. `fn()`). Here's an example:

``` rust
#![feature(asm)]
#![no_main]
#![no_std]

extern crate panic_halt;

use core::sync::atomic::{AtomicPtr, Ordering};

use cortex_m_rt::{entry, exception};

static F: AtomicPtr<fn() -> bool> = AtomicPtr::new(foo as *mut _);

#[inline(never)]
#[entry]
fn main() -> ! {
    if let Some(f) = unsafe { F.load(Ordering::Relaxed).as_ref() } {
        // call via function pointer
        f();
    }

    loop {}
}

fn foo() -> bool {
    // spill variables onto the stack
    unsafe { asm!("" : : "r"(0) "r"(1) "r"(2) "r"(3) "r"(4) "r"(5)) }

    false
}

fn bar() -> bool {
    unsafe { asm!("" : : "r"(0) "r"(1) "r"(2) "r"(3) "r"(4) "r"(5) "r"(6) "r"(7)) }

    true
}

// this handler can change the function pointer at any time
#[exception]
fn SysTick() {
    F.store(bar as *mut _, Ordering::Relaxed);
}
```

The tool produces the following call graph:

<p align="center">
  <a href="https://japaric.github.io/cargo-call-stack/fn.svg">
    <img alt="Function pointers" src="assets/fn.png">
  </a>
</p>

The node `i1 ()*` represents a call via function pointer -- the LLVM type `i1
()*` is equivalent to Rust's `fn() -> bool`. This indirect call could invoke
`foo` or `bar`, the only functions with signature `fn() -> bool`.

## Known limitations

### Lossy type information

To reason about indirect function calls the tool uses the type information
available in the LLVM-IR of the program. This information does not exactly match
Rust's type information and leads to mislabeling of functions. For example,
consider this program:

``` rust
#![feature(asm)]
#![no_main]
#![no_std]

extern crate panic_halt;

use core::{
    ptr,
    sync::atomic::{AtomicPtr, Ordering},
};

use cortex_m_rt::{entry, exception};

static F: AtomicPtr<fn() -> u32> = AtomicPtr::new(foo as *mut _);

#[inline(never)]
#[entry]
fn main() -> ! {
    if let Some(f) = unsafe { F.load(Ordering::Relaxed).as_ref() } {
        // call via function pointer
        f();
    }

    let x = baz();
    unsafe {
        // NOTE(volatile) used to preserve the return value of `baz`
        ptr::read_volatile(&x);
    }

    loop {}
}

// this handler can change the function pointer at any time
#[exception]
fn SysTick() {
    F.store(bar as *mut _, Ordering::Relaxed);
}

fn foo() -> u32 {
    // spill variables onto the stack
    unsafe { asm!("" : : "r"(0) "r"(1) "r"(2) "r"(3) "r"(4) "r"(5)) }

    0
}

fn bar() -> u32 {
    1
}

#[inline(never)]
fn baz() -> i32 {
    unsafe { asm!("" : : "r"(0) "r"(1) "r"(2) "r"(3) "r"(4) "r"(5) "r"(6) "r"(7)) }

    F.load(Ordering::Relaxed) as usize as i32
}
```

The tool produces the following call graph:

<p align="center">
  <a href="https://japaric.github.io/cargo-call-stack/lossy.svg">
    <img alt="Lossy types" src="assets/lossy.png">
  </a>
</p>

Note that the node that represents the indirect function call has type `i32 ()*`
(`fn() -> i32`), not `u32 ()*`. The reason is that there's no `u32` type in
LLVM, there are only signed integers. This leads the tool to wrongly add an edge
between `i32 ()*` and `baz`. If the tool had Rust's type information then this
edge would have not been added.

### No information on compiler intrinsics

Due to how LLVM works all compiler intrinsics, software implementations of
functionality not available as instructions in the target ISA (e.g.
multiplication of 64-bit integers), need to be a separate object file that gets
linked into the final binary.

In Rust all these compiler intrinsics are packed in the
`libcompiler_builtins` rlib. This rlib is distributed via `rustup` and always
compiled without `-Z emit-stack-sizes` so it contains no stack usage
information. Furthermore, the metadata in the `compiler-builtins` crate is never
accessed when compiling a crate so no LLVM-IR is ever produced from it thus the
tool has no information about the call dependencies of the compiler intrinsics.

All these unknowns are currently papered over in the tool using "ad hoc
knowledge". For example, we now that `__aeabi_memclr4` invokes
`__aeabi_memset4` and that `__aeabi_memset4` uses 8 bytes of stack on
`thumbv7m-none-eabi` as of Rust 1.33.0 so the tool uses this information when
building the call graph. Obviously, this approach doesn't scale and this ad hoc
knowledge is likely to get outdated as compiler intrinsics are modified (to
optimize them) over time.

### Miscellaneous

The tool assumes that *all* instances of inline assembly (`asm!`) use zero bytes
of stack. This is not always the case so the tool prints a warning message
for each `asm!` string it encounters.

The tool assumes that branching (calling a function) does not use the stack
(i.e. no register is pushed onto the stack when branching). This may not be true
on *all* the architectures that Rust supports -- it is true on ARM Cortex-M.

The tool only supports ELF binaries because `-Z emit-stack-sizes` only supports
the ELF format.
